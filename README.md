# Embroidery Design Notes

A personal space to document experiments around
digital embroidery, stitch workflows, and creative tools.

It’s a place for notes, small tests, and process exploration
while working with embroidery design and mockups.

- Stitch density and thread behavior
- Embroidery mockup experiments
